Rutger's Computer Science Senior Project: I worked on the design mock-up for the frontpage and designed select elements on various pages. The total team was comprised of 4 members (who worked on front-end and back-end aspects of the website) and was for the Newark Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #12!
